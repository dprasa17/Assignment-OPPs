        "\n",
        "In Python, class methods and static methods are two types of methods that can be defined inside a class. They differ in their usage and purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Bound to the class: Class methods are bound to the class rather than an instance of the class.\n",
        "2. First parameter is the class: Class methods take the class as the first parameter, conventionally named cls.\n",
        "3. Used for class-level operations: Class methods are used for operations that involve the class itself, such as creating alternative constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Not bound to the class or instance: Static methods are not bound to the class or an instance of the class.\n",
        "2. No implicit first parameter: Static methods do not take an implicit first parameter like self or cls.\n",
        "3. Used for utility functions: Static methods are used for utility functions that belong to the class but don't require access to the class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Multiple superclasses: A subclass can inherit from multiple superclasses.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer-24. Method Chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is a programming technique in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. Each method returns the object itself, allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Return self: Each method in the chain returns the object itself (self).\n",
        "2. Chain methods: Methods are called in a sequence, with each method building upon the previous one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

        "\n",
        "    def set_age(self, age):\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",

        "    def set_occupation(self, occupation):\n",
        "        self.occupation = occupation\n",

        "\n",
        "# Output: Name: John, Age: 30, Occupation: Software Engineer\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the set_age and set_occupation methods return self, allowing them to be chained together. The display_info method is then called to display the person's information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Improved readability: Method chaining can improve code readability by reducing the need for temporary variables.\n",
        "2. Concise code: Method chaining enables you to write more concise code, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "3. Easier object configuration: Method chaining makes it easier to configure objects by allowing multiple settings to be applied in a single statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Best Practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Return self: Ensure that each method in the chain returns self to enable method chaining.\n",
        "2. Use meaningful method names: Use meaningful method names to make the code more readable and self-explanatory.\n",
        "3. Avoid over-chaining: Avoid over-chaining methods, as it can make the code harder to read and debug.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer-25. The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an instance of a class to be called as a function. This method is invoked when an instance is used as a callable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Make instances callable: The __call__ method enables instances of a class to be used as callables, allowing them to behave like functions.\n",
        "2. Customizable behavior: By implementing the __call__ method, you can define custom behavior for instances of a class when they are called.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Function-like objects: The __call__ method is useful when you want to create objects that behave like functions but also have additional attributes or methods.\n",

        "3. Decorators: The __call__ method is also used in decorators to wrap functions and modify their behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Increased flexibility: The __call__ method provides increased flexibility in designing classes and objects.\n",
